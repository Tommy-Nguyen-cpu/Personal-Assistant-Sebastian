# Personal Assistant Sebastian
Sebastian was created for my Network Programming class with a main goal of implementing network functionalities within a short timeframe of a month. As a result, my code is nowhere near as perfect as I would have liked nor did I have the opportunity to implement speech-to-text recognition. I plan on adding this feature and fixing some of the issues present in my program in future edits.

 Note: Personal Assistant Sebastian is mostly finished. Many of its functionalities are case sensitive and requires specific wording. This issue will be fixed in the future. Additionally, Sebastian is capable of sending emails, but because it attempts to connect to the server directly (through CMD lines of code), it will almost always throw a "Our server detects..." error. This issue will also be solved in the near future.
 
 Below are some listed functionalities and directions for Sebastian:
 
1. Sebastian is capable of holding simple conversations, but the conversations are based on the response Sebastian expects from the user in the "Conversations" file found within the source folder. Not much has been added to the Conversations file, but adding more is a simple matter.

2. Sebastian is capable of going to websites as long as you type, "go to " followed by the name of the website (do not include .com, .org, etc).

3. You can request the current weather of Boston by simply including the word "weather" in your request/statement (there is a few issues with this but it can be solved in the future as well).

4. You can ask Sebastian to search something up on google by saying, "search up " followed by what it is you want to search up.

5. You can get information off of Wikipedia by saying, "Look up information about " followed by what you want to look up. Note: This is very sensitive to what you type and the casing of your words (whether it is uppercase or lowercase). If you type it incorrectly, Sebastian will say " #Redirect" followed by the term. However, since the user cannot see it (Sebastian only speaks it), it is difficult for the user to know what they need to type correctly (this issue is a simple fix, will fix in the future).

6. Sebastian is capable of getting the system information (Amount of ram, memory, etc) as long as you include "system information" if your request.

7. You can open a new tab by simply typing/including "new tab".

8. You can open applications on your computer as long as you include "open " and the name of the application (this requires the SPECIFIC name of the application and typing it correctly).

9. You can also change the brightness of the computer by just including the term "brightness " followed by a number. For example, "Change brightness to 50" would work.

10. Lastly, you can end the program by clicking on the "x" in the top right corner of the window, or by typing "bye Sebastian".
